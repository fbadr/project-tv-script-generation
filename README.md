# Recurrent Neural Network Project: Generate TV Scripts
## Deep Learning Nanodegree Udacity (with Pytorch)

### Project Overview

In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.


This project includes:

- Preparing Data and Creating Batches
- Building the Neural Network
  - Embedding Layer
  - LSTM Layer
  - Fully Connected Layer

- Choosing the appropriate Hyperparamters  
- Training the Model for 10 epochs
